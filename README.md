#  rinexmod

<img src="./logo_rinexmod.png" width="300">

_rinexmod_ is a tool to batch modify the headers of GNSS data files in RINEX format and rename them correctly.  
It supports Hatanaka-compressed and non-compressed files, RINEX versions 2 and 3/4, and short and long naming conventions.  
It is developed in Python 3, and can be run from the command line or directly in API mode by calling a python function.  
The required input metadata can come from a sitelog file, or be manually entered as arguments to the command line or the called function.  
It is available under the GNU license on the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/IPGP/rinexmod  

v2+ - 2023-05-15 - Pierre Sakic - sakic@ipgp.fr  
v1  - 2022-02-07 - Félix Léger  - leger@ipgp.fr  

Version: 3.4.2 
Date: 2025-03-04

## Tools overview

### Main tool

* `rinexmod_run` takes a list of RINEX Hatanaka compressed files (.d.Z or .d.gz or .rnx.gz),
loops the rinex files list to modify the file's headers. It then writes them back to Hatanaka
compressed format in an output folder. It also permits to rename the files, changing
the four first characters of the file name with another station code. It can write
those files with the long name naming convention with the --longname option.

### Annex tools

They are stored in `bin/misc_tools` folder.

* `get_m3g_sitelogs.py` will get the last version of site logs from the M3G repository
and write them in an observatory-dependent subfolder.

* `crzmeta.py` will extract RINEX file's header information and prompt the result. 
This permits to quickly access the header information without uncompressing the file manually. 
It's a teqc-free equivalent of teqc +meta.

## Installation

### Assisted installation 
The tool is designed in Python 3, and you must have it installed on your machine.

You can use `pip` to install the last GitHub-hosted version with the following command:  
```pip install git+https://github.com/IPGP/rinexmod```

Since the version 3.4.0, the frontend program `rinexmod_run` is available directly when you call it in your console.

### Required external modules

*NB*: Following the assisted installation procedure above, the required external modules will be automatically installed.

You need:
 * _Python_ `hatanaka` library from M. Valgur
 * `pycountry` to associate country names with their ISO abbreviations (facultative but recommended):  
 * `matplotlib` for plotting samples intervals with crzmeta  
 * `colorlog` to get the pretty colored log outputs
 * `pandas` to for internal low-level data management  

You can install them with: 
```
pip install hatanaka pycountry matplotlib colorlog pandas
```

## _rinexmod_ in command lines interface

### rinexmod_run

This is the main frontend function. It takes a list of RINEX Hatanaka compressed files (.d.Z or .d.gz or .rnx.gz),
loop over the RINEX files list to modify the file's header. It then writes them back to Hatanaka-compressed
format in an output folder. It also allows to rename the files, changing
the four first characters of the file name with another site code. It can write
those files with the long name naming convention with the --longname option.

Three ways of passing parameters to modify headers are possible: `sitelog`, `modification_kw` and `station_info`/`lfile_apriori` (from GAMIT/GLOBK software).

* ```
   --sitelog : you pass sitelogs file. The argument must be a sitelog path or the path of a folder
               containing sitelogs. You then have to pass a list of files and the script will
               assign sitelogs to correspondig files, based on the file's name.
               The script will take the start and end time of each proceeded file
               and use them to extract from the sitelog the station instrumentation
               of the corresponding period and fill file's header with following infos:  
                       Four Character ID
                       X coordinate (m)
                       Y coordinate (m)
                       Z coordinate (m)
                       Receiver Type
                       Serial Number
                       Firmware Version
                       Satellite System (will translate this info to one-letter code,
                                         see RinexFile.set_observable_type())
                       Antenna Type
                       Serial Number
                       Marker->ARP Up Ecc. (m)
                       Marker->ARP East Ecc(m)
                       Marker->ARP North Ecc(m)

## Other command line functions

### crzmeta

Extract metadata from crz file.

With -p option, will plot the file's samples intervals
```
EXAMPLE:
./crzmeta  RINEXFILE (-p)
```

### get_m3g_sitelogs

This script will get the last version of sitelogs from M3G repository and write them
in an observatory dependent subfolder set in 'observatories'.
The -d --delete option will delete the old version to get only the last version even
in a name-changing case.

```
USE :

* OUTPUTFOLDER : Folder where to write the downloaded sitelogs.

OPTION :

* -d : delete : Delete old sitelogs in storage folder. This permits to have only the last version, as version changing sitelogs changes of name.

EXAMPLE:

	./get_m3g_sitelogs OUTPUTFOLDER (-d)
```

## _rinexmod_ error messages

_rinexmod_ will prompt errors when arguments are wrong. Apart from this, it will prompt and save to file errors and waring
occurring on specific files from the rinex list. Here are the error codes :

`01 - The specified file does not exists`

That means that the input file containing a list of rinex files is wrong and references a file that is not present. It can also mean that the file was deleted between the list generation and the script launch, but this case should be quite rare.

`02 - Not an observation Rinex file`

The file name does not correspond to the classic pattern (it doesn't match the regular expression for new and old convention naming model ). Most of time, it's because it is not a d rinex file (for example, navigation file).

`03 - Invalid  or empty Zip file`

The Zip file is corrupted or empty

`04 - Invalid Compressed Rinex file`

The CRX Hatanaka file is corrupted.

`05 - Less than two epochs in the file, reject`

Not enought data in the file to extract a sample rate, and data not relevant because insufficient. Reject the file.

`30 - Input and output folders are the same !`

The file will not be proceeded as rinexmod does not modify files inplace. Check your outputfolder.

`31 - The subfolder can not be reconstructed for file`

The script tries to find the 'reconstruct' subfolder in the file's path to replace it with outputfolder, and does not find it.

`32 - Station's country not retrevied, will not be properly renamed`

When using --name option, that will rename file with rinex long name convention, it needs to retrieve the file's country.
It tries to do so using an external file of list of 9 char ids. the concerned rinex file's station seems to be absent
from this station list file.

`33 - File\'s station does not correspond to provided sitelog - use -f option to force`

The station name retrieved from the provided sitelog does not correspond to the station's name retrieved from
the file's headers. Do not process.

`34 - File's station does not correspond to provided sitelog, processing anyway`

The station name retrieved from the provided sitelog does not correspond to the station's name retrieved from
the file's headers. As the --force option was provided, the file has been processed.

`35 - No instrumentation corresponding to the data period on the sitelog`

There is no continuous instrumentation period in the sitelog taht corresponds to the rinex file's dates. We can thus not fill the header.

`36 - Instrumentation cames from merged periods of sitelog with different firmwares, processing anyway`

We provided the --ignore option, so the consecutive periods of instrumentation for witch only the firmware version of the receiver has changed have been merged. We used this period to fill this file's header.
