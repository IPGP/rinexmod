## Changelog

### v3.4.0 (Dec, 2024)

- shell programs are now in a `bin` folder and are set as executable in the `setup.py`
- **the frontend command line interface program has been renamed `rinexmod_run.py` to avoid conflict with the module name**
- add `shortname` option to force RINEX file renaming with short name convention, and modify `longname` option to force RINEX file renaming with long name convention
